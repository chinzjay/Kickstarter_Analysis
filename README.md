# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Purpose
The purpose of this report is to help Louise the playwright identify how the campaigns fare to their launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### *Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date*
This report describes the relation of the outcomes to their launch dates. Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png shows a line graph of the Month of Launch (x-axis) vs Outcomes (y-axis). The chart can be filtered based on the outcomes as well as the year of the launch. ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png](https://github.com/chinzjay/Kickstarter_Analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

From the chart, it can be seen that the month of launch has an impact on the outcome. Campaigns during the month of May has the highest rate of success. It can also be seen that the campaigns during the month May, July and October has a higher rate of failure compared to the other months.

### *Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals*
![Outcomes_vs_Goals.png](https://github.com/chinzjay/Kickstarter_Analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
This report describes the relation of the outcomes of the campaigns to their goal amount. Outcomes_vs_Goals.png depicts a line graph that shows the relation between the goal of the campaign to the outcome. It can be seen from the graph that the Goal-amount range is plotted on the x-axis to the Percentage of the outcome on the y-axis. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the challenges encountered during the analysis was identifying the correct fields to be plotted on the axis. It took some trial and error during the analysis of the report to identify the correct fields for the chart axis.
## Results 
- It can be concluded from the analysis (Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) that the month of May is the best time of the year for a successful campaign. The failure rate is higher in the months May through July and October. It is evident from the analysis(Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) that the campaigns with goals Less than 1000 has the best rate of success followed by the ones with goals between 1000-4999. Campaigns with a goal range higher than 45000 has highest failure rates.

- It can be concluded from the results that the goal range has to be less than 4999 and has to be launched in the month of May for the best success rate.

- The size of the dataset is limited. Hence the analysis report might not be reflect the actual reports. Another limitation is that the DAte on which the campaign reached the Goal is not available. 

- We can make an analysis of the success rates of the campaigns based on the duration of the project with the given dtaset. We can also make a chart to identify the relation between the outcome of project bassed on the categories.  A table can also be plotted to identify the popular category in different countries.
