# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Purpose
The purpose of this report is to help Louise, the playwright to identify how the campaigns fare to their launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The report consists of analysis of the campaign outcomes based on the Launch Date and the Goal Range. Graphs were plotted which were then analysed to make conclusions for the outcomes based on the different criterias.

### *Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date*
A new sheet [Kickstarter_Analysis](https://github.com/chinzjay/Kickstarter_Analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter_Analysiss.xlsx) was created (Theater Outcomes by Launch Date) in the Kickstarter_Analysis to analyze the relation of the outcomes to their launch dates. A table was created with the Date of Launch and Outcomes data which had the filters for Outcomes of the Campaign and the Year of Launch. The chart below represents a line graph of the Month of Launch (x-axis) vs Outcomes (y-axis).

|Fig 1. Line graph to analyze the Outcomes based on their Launch Date|

It can be seen from Fig 1. that the month of launch has an impact on the campaign's outcome. Campaigns during the month of May has the highest rate of success. It can also be seen that the campaigns during the month of May, July and October has a higher rate of failure compared to the other months.

### *Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals*
A new sheet was created (Outcomes based on Goals) in the [Kickstarter_Analysis](https://github.com/chinzjay/Kickstarter_Analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter_Analysiss.xlsx) to analyze the relation between the outcomes to their goal range. A table was created with the Goal Range, Number of Successful, Failed and Canceled Outcomes, Total Number of Projects and the Percentage of Successful, Failed and Canceled Outcomes. The chart below depicts a line graph of the Goal Range (x-axis) to the Percentage of Outcomes (y-axis).

|Fig 2. Line graph to analyze the Goal Range and Percentage of Outcomes|

It can be seen from Fig 2. that the Goal Range has an impact on the campaign's outcome. Campaigns during the month of May has the highest rate of success. It can also be seen that the campaigns during the month May, July and October has a higher rate of failure compared to the other months.
 
## Results 
- It can be concluded from the analysis based on Fig 1. that the month of May maybe the best time of the year for a successful campaign. The failure rate is higher in the months May through July and October. It is evident from the analysis based on Fig 2. that the campaigns with goals less than 1000 may have the best rate of success followed by the ones with goals between the range 1000-4999. Campaigns with a goal range higher than 45000 has higher failure rates.

- It can be concluded that the campaigns with the goal range less than 1000 and launched in the month of May may have an optimum success rate.

- Listed below are the limitations of this dataset
   * The size of the dataset is limited. 
   * Lack of Date/Time period on which the campaign reached its goal.
   * Various other factors could also have an influence on the outcome of the campaign. With more factors included, a more accurate analysis can be made. 
   
- Further detailed analysis can be made with
   * A chart of Duration of the Project vs the Outcomes 
   * A chart of Categories vs Outcome of Project 
   * A table for the popular categories in different countries
